      Hey there! My name is Michel and I&apos;m a dedicated Full-Stack Developer
      with a special place in my heart for React and TypeScript. My professional
      journey has been a thrilling ride, filled with projects that stretched
      from simple websites to complex factory applications, each teaching me
      invaluable lessons about the tech world and beyond.
      <br />
      But who am I beyond the code? Well, I&apos;m a bit of a thrill-seeker and
      a creator at heart. Growing up in a quaint town in northern Germany, I
      developed a love for the simpler, yet profound things in life. Whether
      it&apos;s carving the streets on my skateboard (admittedly, with more
      enthusiasm than skill) or embracing the serenity of water sports, I find
      joy in the push and pull of the tide and the wind against my face.
      <br />
      When I&apos;m not chasing the next big swell or working on my latest tech
      project, I love getting my hands dirty - building things out of wood or
      tinkering with microcontrollers. It&apos;s this passion for creating,
      whether it&apos;s crafting a piece of furniture or programming a new app,
      that really lights my fire.
      <br />
      And yes, I&apos;ve got a soft spot for hipster fashion. There&apos;s
      something about combining the old with the new, the traditional with the
      modern, that just speaks to me, both in my personal style and in the work
      I do.
      <br />
      In the tech community, I&apos;m all about sharing and growing together. I
      frequently attend and speak at local tech meetups and conferences, diving
      into the latest in frontend development. These gatherings are my jam - a
      place to connect, inspire, and be inspired.
