      <p>
        Hey there! My name is Michel and I&apos;m a dedicated Full-Stack
        Developer with a special place in my heart for React and TypeScript. My
        professional journey has been a thrilling ride, filled with projects
        that stretched from simple websites to complex factory applications,
        each teaching me invaluable lessons about the tech world and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        But who am I beyond the code? Well, I&apos;m a bit of a thrill-seeker
        and a creator at heart. Growing up in a quaint town in northern Germany,
        I developed a love for the simpler, yet profound things in life. Whether
        it&apos;s carving the streets on my skateboard (admittedly, with more
        enthusiasm than skill) or embracing the serenity of water sports, I find
        joy in the push and pull of the tide and the wind against my face.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        When I&apos;m not chasing the next big swell or working on my latest
        tech project, I love getting my hands dirty - building things out of
        wood or tinkering with microcontrollers. It&apos;s this passion for
        creating, whether it&apos;s crafting a piece of furniture or programming
        a new app, that really lights my fire.
